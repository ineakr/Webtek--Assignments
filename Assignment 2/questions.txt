Questions Assignment 2:

1. Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and
external stylesheets?
- There are five levels of styles, and these are ordered in a hierarchy. The
inline style has highest precedence. Therefore, the inline style will override
the other.


2. Give a brief example of when to use ID (#id) and when to use classes (.class)
in CSS.
- ID's are used when there's one single thing to style. For example if you want
the main title to have a bigger font-size than the other headings. The ID
must be unique.

Classes are used when there are several of the same thing. For example if
there are buttons, and all the buttons are going to be styled the same way.


3. What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
- RGBA means how much red, green and blue there is in the color. The colors that
can be expressed with RGB is therefore a mix between these colors. The RGB
stands for the colors. The A stands for alpha, which is the opacity of the
color. The RGB is a number between 0 and 255, while the alpha is a number
between 0 and 1.


4. Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body
element?
- The body is where the content of the browser is. The head, on the other hand,
is where the information about the document is. CSS is the information about
the styling of the document, and therefore are included in the head.


5. What CSS selector matches all the p elements inside the article element in
the following HTML?
- The type selector.
    p {
    ...
    }
