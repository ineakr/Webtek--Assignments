        Last year I took an introduction course to Python. At this point
        programming was all new to me. I found that coding was very interesting and
        fun. This semester I am very excited to learn HTML, CSS and JS. I don't
        have any experience of webtechnology from before.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very excited for this course. I love problem solving and learning
        new things. It may be a difficult course as everything is new to me, but
        hopefully It will be fun aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also excited for the group project. It's fun that the course most
        of the time is practical. In addition I hope to get to know some of the other
        students through the group project, as I take this course as an individual subject.

        <li> The server recives requests from the client, and sends services back to the client.
        For example can the server connect the client to a webpage. </li>
        <li> The client is where the user operate. The client requests services
        from the server and then recives it. Then, the user can for example display
        a website. </li>
        <li> The IP stands for Internet Protocol, and is a set of rules for the internet.
        It makes it possible to communicate over the internet. The IP address is an
        unique code for a website or a device connected to the internet. </li>
        <li> DNS stands for Domain Name System. When an user wants to visit a webpage,
        the DNS recives a domain name and returns the IP address for the website. If
        the DNS don't have the IP address, it sends it to another DNS until it recives the
        right address. The DNS saves the IP address for the next time the user
        wants to visit the page. </li>
        <li> The difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web is that
        the internet is a network of networks. The internet is a connection between many networks.
        The world wide web on the otherhand, is an application on the internet. For example
        a website.  </li>
        <li> HTML is the code language for the structure of a website. </li>
