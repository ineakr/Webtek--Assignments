Questions

1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
    The difference between position: absolute and position:fixed is that
    the element does not move when the user scrolls when fixed. When absolute,
    the element moves when the user scrolls.

2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
    To access the third element within another element, you use the
    pseudo-selector :nth-child(0n+3). For example if you want the third
    element in an ordered list to be blue, the code would be

    ol li:nth-child(0n+3) {
      color: blue;
    }
