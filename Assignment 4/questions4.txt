1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
    - On mobile phones it is possible that mobile data is being used. If that's 
    the case, the website uses more data by autoplaying a video.
    - Because of user experience. It is not good user experience that
    the website starts playing a video out of nowhere. On a laptop the video would 
    not be so dominant. It could be a little window in the corner. That is not
    the case on a mobile phone.

2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a device with 
   320x568 resolution?
    - It would not do anything. It says that if the screen has
    a width between 768px and 1024px, the #logo would disappear.
    In this case the screens width is 320px, and therefore nothing would 
    happen.

3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions
like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
    - You only need one stylesheet, instead of one for each device.
    - It is important to not repeat yourself in web development. This is something you avoid
    by only needing a single sheetstyle.
    - Saves time.
